## Patch updates for release v1.0.39
This update contains improvements to the way infinite values are detected

## Test environments
* OS X install: R 3.6.0
* win-builder: R-devel

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

The following NOTE appeared in the win-builder check:
* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
Maintainer: 'Nicholas J Clark <nicholas.j.clark1214@gmail.com>'

No action was taken, as this note apparently reminds CRAN maintainers to check that the submission actually comes from myself and not anybody else.
