## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added the paper reference to the Description field of the DESCRIPTION
* Changed all \dontrun fields to \donttest
* Removed \dontrun wraps from example code chunks that run in less than 5 seconds
* Fixed an error in an example in the cv_MRF_diag function
* Removed the LICENSE file as it contains no extra restrictions on top of the normal GPL-3 restrictions

## Test environments
* OS X install: R 3.3.3
* win-builder: R-devel

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

The following NOTE appeared in the win-builder check:
* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
Maintainer: 'Nicholas J Clark <nicholas.j.clark1214@gmail.com>'

No action was taken, as this note apparently reminds CRAN maintainers to check that the submission actually comes from myself and not anybody else.
